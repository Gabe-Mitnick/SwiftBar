# SwiftBar

Add custom menu bar programs on macOS in three easy steps:

- ... there is no 3rd step!

Get plugins from awesome [BitBar repository](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins)

## How to get SwiftBar
Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar/releases)

or Install with Homebrew

```
brew tap melonamin/formulae
brew cask install SwiftBar
```

Runs on macOS Catalina(10.15) and up.

## ...or build it from source

## Creating Plugins

To add a new plugin to SwiftBar you need to create an executable script following the required format(see below) and put it into `Plugin Folder`. 

### Plugin Folder

With the first launch, Swiftbar will ask you to set the `Plugin Folder`, SwiftBar will try to import every file in this folder as a plugin.

**Important**:
* hidden folders are ignored
* nested folders are traversed by SwiftBar

### Plugin Naming

Plugin files must adopt the following format:

```
{name}.{time}.{ext}
```

* name - anything you want
* time - resresh interval, should be a number + duration modifier(see below)
* ext - file extension

Duration modifier:
* s - seconds, i.e. 1s - refresh every second
* m - minute, i.e. 10m - refresh every ten minutes
* h - hour, i.e. 3h - refresh every three hours
* d - day, i.e. 1d - refresh every day

Example filename: `date.1m.sh`

## Plugin API

Plugin is an executable script in the language of your choice. When SwiftBar detects a new file in `Plugin Folder` it makes this file executable if needed and runs it. 

Script should produce output(STDOUT) in the required format(see next chapter), error should be redirected to STDERR. 

Plugin API is adopted from the [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar), which means that SwiftBar can run any existing BitBar plugin.

### Script Output

When parsing plugin output SwiftBar recognizes the following blocks:
- Header - responsible for what you see in the menu bar
- Body - responsible for dropdown menu contents

`Header` is everything before first `---`, each `---` after the first one will be interpreted as a menu separator.
You have one or more lines in the header.

The simplest plugin looks like this:

```
echo "This is Menu Title"
```

Multiple title plugin, the title will be cycled in the menu bar and show in the dropdown menu:

```
echo "This is a primary Menu Title"
echo "This is a secondary Menu Title"
echo "This is a n-th Menu Title"
---
echo "This is not a Menu Title, this will be showed in the drop-down menu only"
```

Script output for both header and body is split by line(`\n`), each line must follow this format:
```
<Item Title> | [param = ...] 
```
where:
- "Item Title" can be any string, this will be used as a menu item title.
- [param = ...] is an optional set of parameters\modificators, each parameter is a key-value separated by `=`. Use `|` to separate parameters from the title.

Here is the list of supported parameters:

**Text Formatting**:
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | 
| `color` | CSS color or HEX |Sets item text color |
| `font` | macOS font name| Sets font name to use in item text|
| `size` | Number| Sets item text size|
| `length`| Number| Trims item text to a provided number of characters, the full title will be displayed in a tooltip |
| `trim` | True | Trims whitespace characters|
| `emojize` | False | Disables parsing of GitHub style emojis, i.e. mushroom: into üçÑ|

**Visuals**:
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | 
| `dropdown` | False | Applicable to items in `Header`, when set to False item will not be displayed in dropdown menu, but will be cycled in the menu bar|
| `alternate` |True| Marks a line as an alternative to the previous one for when the Option key is pressed in the dropdown|
| `image` | Image encoded in Base64| Sets an image for item|
| `templateImage`| Image encoded in Base64| Same as `image`, but the image is a template image. Template images consist of black and clear colors (and an alpha channel). Template images are not intended to be used as standalone images and are usually mixed with other content to create the desired final appearance.|
| `sfimage` | SFSymbol name| Sets an image for item from [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)|
| `checked` | True | Sets a checkmark in front of the item|
| `tooltip` | Text | Sets a tooltip for the item |

**Actions**:
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | 
| `refresh` | True | PLugin Script will be executed on item click |
| `href` | Absolute URL | Sets an URL to open when item clicked |
| `bash` | Absolute file path| Executable script to run in Shell |
| `terminal` | False | `bash` script will be run in the background, instead of launching the Terminal |
| `params` | param0=,param1=, param10=... | Parameters for `bash` script |
| `shortcut` | CMD+OPT+T | Hotkey assigned to item, if item is in header hotkey will show the menu, otherwise hotkey will launch associated action|


### Script Metadata

It is recommended to include metadata in plugin script, metadata is used in the About Plugin screen in SwiftBar. 
SwiftBar adopts metadata format suggested by BitBar:
```
# <bitbar.title>Title goes here</bitbar.title>
# <bitbar.version>v1.0</bitbar.version>
# <bitbar.author>Your Name</bitbar.author>
# <bitbar.author.github>your-github-username</bitbar.author.github>
# <bitbar.desc>Short description of what your plugin does.</bitbar.desc>
# <bitbar.image>http://www.hosted-somewhere/pluginimage</bitbar.image>
# <bitbar.dependencies>python,ruby,node</bitbar.dependencies>
# <bitbar.abouturl>http://url-to-about.com/</bitbar.abouturl>
```

## Logs and Error

If plugin fails to run SwiftBar will show ‚ö†Ô∏è in the menu bar, you can see details by clicking on Error in dropdown menu.
Use macOS console app to view SwiftBar logs.
